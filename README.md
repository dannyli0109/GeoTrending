Problem
The concept behind this project was to find social and news trends based on location, to allow people to become more informed as to local events and developments. This required the use of APIs from twitter to compile data on trends in Australia, the information which is then used to find local news reports.

Technology
For this project the group used ruby on rails for the build and heroku for deployment.


Challenges
There were many challenges faced during this project:
  1. Clarity on the idea behind the project
  2. Issues with API access and compilation of data (specifically facebook)
  3. Navigating API and formulating returned data

Future Developments
In the future we would like to have multiple sources for data trends which when compiled give a more accurate representation of local trends. Also making the site more user friendly and appealing to users. Additional being able to categories trends so that users can have more control.
